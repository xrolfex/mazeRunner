# Maze Generation Algorithms

This folder contains all maze generation algorithms for the MazeRunner web application.

## Algorithms
- **dfs.js** — Depth-First Search maze generation
- **prim.js** — Prim's Algorithm maze generation
- **kruskal.js** — Kruskal's Algorithm maze generation

Each file exports a function that generates a maze of a given size and returns the maze grid, animation steps, and start/end points.

All algorithms are documented with JSDoc comments for clarity and maintainability.
