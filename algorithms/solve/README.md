# Maze Solving Algorithms

This folder contains all maze solving algorithms for the MazeRunner web application.

## Algorithms
- **dfs.js** — Depth-First Search maze solving
- **bfs.js** — Breadth-First Search maze solving
- **astar.js** — A* Search maze solving

Each file exports a function that takes a maze, start, and end point, and returns the solution steps.

All algorithms are documented with JSDoc comments for clarity and maintainability.
